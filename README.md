# TODCOR
This is a thin, no installation required, implementation of the Two-dimensional Correlation algorithm (TODCOR) to derive the radial velocities of the two components of a spectrum ([ref](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994ApJ...420..806Z/abstract)).

This code implements the TODCOR algorithm with the following improvements:
1. More accurate alpha-fitting mode, including ignoring non-physical negative-alpha solutions and corrections to the (A4) equations in the TODCOR paper ([ref](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994ApJ...420..806Z/abstract)).
2. More accurate results for a short spectrum, by better handling of spectrum/templates edge effects.
